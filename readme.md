# 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp for 2022
## _My personal journey to 100 projects_


My name is Hoyoung Lee. This is my personal journey to coding 100 days & 100 projects. I am basically beginning from "Hello World" in a sense. I have tried many different tutorials and watched so many YouTube videos, only to feel like I leanred nothing.

So I am changing to learn by doing. I am following the Bootcamp from The App Brewary and Dr. Angela Yu. I decided to share the work to keep myself accountable for the next few months.
